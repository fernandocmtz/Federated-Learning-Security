# Federated-Learning-Security
This project explores security threats in Federated Learning (FL) by implementing a Label Flipping Attack and using Median Aggregation as a defense. It includes a CNN model, FL server-client setup, and evaluation metrics like accuracy and convergence. Built with PyTorch, FLWR, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
